  <!--Descriptions and Technological and Tools used-->

          <div class="project-description">

                  <h2><span>1st HTML v1</span></h2>
                  <p> The website is constructed using a combination of HTML5, CSS3, floats, 
                        ID and class selectors, navigation bar, images, footer, and hyperlinks. 
                        The resulting website exhibits a visually pleasing and interactive interface with a professional layout and design.
                  </p>
                  

                  
                  <h2><span>HTML v2</span></h2>
                  <p>The website is designed with a minimalistic approach that emphasises the creation of a professional and 
                          user-friendly website. The website was built with HTML5 for content organisation and CSS3 for content styling. 
                          The webpage includes a header with a background image, a navigation bar with links to the various page sections, 
                          and multiple content sections. The website includes a section about the employed web technologies, including the 
                          HTML5 and CSS3 logos along with their respective image sources. The final section of the website's footer contains a
                           Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence. The CSS code included in the style.
                          The CSS file is used to format the page's layout, typography, colour scheme, and spatial arrangement, 
                          which includes the background image, header, navigation bar, and content sections.
                  </p>
                  


                  
              
                <h2><span> Paper scissor</span></h2>
                <p>With HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the website is a simple version of the game "Rock, Paper, Scissors." 
                      The main tools and methods that were used to build the website are:
                      HTML stands for "Hypertext Markup Language." It is used to describe how a webpage is put together. 
                      This includes titles, paragraphs, links, and buttons, among other things. CSS is used to style the circular 
                      images of "rock," "paper," and "scissors," as well as the link to the instructions.
                      Using Java Script The code has ways to handle events for the circles with "onclick" 
                      properties, which make the play() function run when the circle is clicked. JavaScript is used to control 
                      the game's logic, figure out what the user's choice means, and show an alert message that says what happened.
                      The SpeechSynthesis API turns text into speech. The say() method is used to turn the alert information into 
                      spoken language so that the user can hear it.
                </p>
                

                
                <h2><span>Flat Land</span></h2>
                <p>Website techniques:
                        HTML organises a website. HTML markup—meta tags, links to external CSS and JavaScript files, 
                        and div elements for layout—accomplishes this.
                        CSS defines the website's visual appearance, including font family, box-sizing, padding, width, 
                        height, background colour, border radius, and border properties for elements like body, #square, 
                        and #word. JavaScript powers website interactivity and functionality. The tasks involve greetings, colour changes, 
                        and contemporary vocabulary. The #square component needs click and mouseover event listeners.
                        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript create an interactive website with distinct styles and fluid content.
                </p>
                

                  
                  <h2><span>To do</span></h2>
                        <p>Description: This simple to-do list programme enables users add, check off, and filter items.
                        Techniques include: The ToDo list interface is created using HTML form components, input fields, 
                        buttons, and list items. CSS defines font family, font size, margin, and text decoration characteristics
                        to format the website's components. JavaScript enhances the website's to-do list application. 
                        User activities change the website's content and behaviour using DOM manipulation. 
                        Add event listeners to buttons and list items, change element classes to implement styles, 
                        and change the display property to show or hide tasks based on their status.
                  </p>
                  


                  
                  <h2><span>Rss Reader</span></h2>
                  <p>The website is a basic RSS reader that lets users enter an RSS feed URL and obtain content. HTML, 
                        CSS, and JavaScript generate a header, main content, and footer for the website. 
                        The header has an RSS feed URL input box and an article fetching button. The main content section 
                        will dynamically add RSS feed items. Creative Commons licence images and licence details are at the bottom.
                        XMLHttpRequest, a JavaScript object, sends GET queries to the RSS2JSON API, which transforms RSS feeds to JSON.
                        The JavaScript function parses the JSON response and dynamically produces DOM components for each item, including 
                        title and description elements. The primary content section receives the produced pieces.
                        CSS styles the header, main text, and footer with little modification. A top navigation bar, centred main
                        text, and centred footer make the website simple and tidy. For layout, CSS uses width, padding, and text alignment.
                        JavaScript event listeners manage user interactions like clicking the "Get Articles" button to show RSS feed
                        items on the page. JavaScript displays "The request failed; please check your RSS URL" in the main content area
                        whenever a request fails.

      <h2>Reflection<span></span></h2>
      <p>Learning CSS, HTML, and JavaScript for the first time, as 
      well as gaining a better grasp of the Document Object Model (DOM), and 
      JavaScript event handling, has been an eye-opening trip for me as a commerce student 
      specialising in IT and IS.After six weeks of intensive study, my opinion of web development's potential 
      and flexibility has changed significantly. I started out by learning the 
      fundamentals of CSS and HTML, which allowed me to organise and create web pages with a 
      focus on aesthetics. Having the ability to make dynamic and interactive online content using CSS was fascinating to me.
      As I learned more about JavaScript, I was impressed by the power it gave web sites in terms of 
      functionality and engagement. I learned the fundamentals of JavaScript syntax and programming concepts including variables, data types, operators, and control flow. </p>
      
      
      <p>The notion of the DOM, though, is what introduced me to the fluidity of web programming.
      It was a game-changer for me to learn that the Document Object Model (DOM) specifies the structure of 
      an HTML document and allows for the manipulation of its elements using JavaScript. I gained knowledge on 
      how to dynamically update web content by choosing and editing items, navigating the DOM tree, and more. 
      The ability to record and react to events like button clicks, form submissions, and key strokes was another 
      amazing idea I learned while working with JavaScript.</p>


      <p>I learned how to apply these theories in the actual world through coding exercises and projects. 
      I am now capable of making dynamic web sites with flexible designs and interesting user experiences. 
      Along the journey, I realised the significance of debugging and troubleshooting as I overcame obstacles 
      and improved from my mistakes.</p>


      <p>Even as a commerce student, I recognise the need of knowing how to build websites in the modern world.
      A company's online presence and interactions with customers can benefit substantially from its employees'
      abilities to design, develop, and manage websites and web apps. Additionally, I see the possibility for 
      businesses to leverage JavaScript and the DOM to create tailor-made solutions like e-commerce websites, 
      interactive forms, and data visualisations.
      In sum, it has been both difficult and gratifying to learn CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and the Document 
      Object Model (DOM) for the first time.  
      I'm excited to go deeper into web development and use what I've learned in my future studies and career.</p>
